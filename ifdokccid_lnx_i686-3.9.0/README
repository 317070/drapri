 Driver Installation
------------------------------

After you have downloaded the tarball extract it in any directory
 
  # tar -xzvf ifd<driver-package-name>.tar.gz

change to this directory  and run as root user
  
  # ./install

This script checks if PCSCLite is installed and then copies 
the CCID driver bundle to /usr/local/pcsc/drivers directory,
 which is the default PCSCLite USB driver dropdir. 
You can change the dropdir by providing another install path 
to the install script using the option '-d':

  # ./install -d /path/to/my/dropdir

Q: What driver version am I using at the moment?

A: You can determine the driver version number by having a look at the PCSCLite
   bundle directory (usually /usr/local/pcsc/drivers): The bundle name of our 
   devices drivers contain the driver version number. 
   The driver is also printing a version string every time a reader is activated 
   by PCSCLite: This string can be found either in the system log
   or on the console you started PCSCLite daemon from.


Q: I am experiencing problems using smartcard XYZ !

A: Please send an email to our support address eusupport@hidglobal.com containing
   a description of the chain of events which lead to the misbehavior (reader plug-in/-off, 
   SC insertion/removal, commands sent to the SC or at least the program used to talk to the SC), 
   also include the name and ATR of the smartcard, and add the PCSCLite log events (should be written to
   your system log /var/log/messages or similar). Your systems kernel version and kind of distribution
   may also be helpful.
